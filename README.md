# Face_detection_anti_spoofing

Welcome to Face_detection_anti_spoofing GitHub repository! This repository contains code and resources for building a model to detect 
whether a person is real or a spoof using computer vision techniques. <br>
We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for this purpose, along with a pre-trained face detection model from MediaPipe.

# Project Overview
In today's digital age, ensuring the authenticity of individuals captured by security cameras is of paramount importance.
The goal of this project is to develop a robust solution that can distinguish between real individuals and spoof attempts.
Spoofing can include various methods such as displaying a photograph or using a video feed to deceive the camera.

To accomplish this task, we employ a CNN-based model that has been trained on a dataset comprising two main categories: <br>

Real Person Data: This category contains images and videos of actual individuals.<br>
Spoof Person Data: This category includes synthetic or manipulated data, such as photographs, videos, or other types of impersonation
attempts.<br>

I hope this repository helps you in building an effective solution for real vs. spoof person detection in security camera systems. 
If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers. Good luck with your project!

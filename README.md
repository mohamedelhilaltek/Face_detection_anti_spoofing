# Face_detection_anti_spoofing

Welcome to Face_detection_anti_spoofing GitHub repository! This repository contains code and resources for building a model to detect 
whether a person is real or a spoof using computer vision techniques. <br>
We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for this purpose, along with a pre-trained face detection model from MediaPipe.

# Project Overview
In today's digital age, ensuring the authenticity of individuals captured by security cameras is of paramount importance.
The goal of this project is to develop a robust solution that can distinguish between real individuals and spoof attempts.
Spoofing can include various methods such as displaying a photograph or using a video feed to deceive the camera.

To accomplish this task, we employ a CNN-based model that has been trained on a dataset comprising two main categories: <br>

Real Person Data: This category contains images of actual individuals.<br>
Spoof Person Data: This category includes images of spoof.<br>

I hope this repository helps you in building an effective solution for real vs. spoof person detection in security camera systems.
